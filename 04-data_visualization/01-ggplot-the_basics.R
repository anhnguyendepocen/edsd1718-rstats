#'## First steps: data, layers and aesthetics
#'
#' Interactive plots displayed in a web-browser are all the rage nowadays with
#' [Gapminder World](http://www.gapminder.org/world) being a true classic of
#' the genre.
#'
#' ![Gapminder World](gapminder_world.png)
#'
#' Today we shall recreate the above chart and in doing so learn the basics
#' of ggplot. Key concepts we will tackle are *aesthetics*, *layers*, *scales*,
#' and *facets*.

#' The command `library(tidyverse)` loads ggplot plus other packages for reading
#' data, transforming data and reshaping data. Look [here](http://tidyverse.org/)
#' for more information on the tidyverse -- a collection of packages with a
#' common design philosophy.

library(tidyverse)

#' Each ggplot starts with *data*. **Data must be a data frame**! Today we
#' will use data which comes in form of an R package: The gapminder data.

library(gapminder)
is.data.frame(gapminder)
head(gapminder)

#' First step in plotting with ggplot: provide ggplot with a data frame:

ggplot(data = gapminder)

#' ggplot knows about our data but nothing happens yet. We need to add a
#' *layer*. **We add elements to a plot by adding them with a `+`.**

ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))

#' `aes` stands for *aesthetics*: Mappings between variables in our data and
#' visual properties. Each column in our data frame is a variable. Visual
#' properties are manifold and can be `x`, `y`, `colour`, `size`, `shape`,
#' `alpha`, `fill`, `radius`, `linetype`, `group`...
#'
#' We use the `aes()` function to map `x`-position to the variable `Time` and
#' `y`-position to the variable `weight`. **Every time you map a variable to a
#' visual property you do it inside `aes()`**
#'
#' The plot looks strange. A single line is drawn across all data points. We
#' want separate lines -- one time series per country...

ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country))

#' Note that we don't write `x = gapminder$year` or `y = "lifeExp"`. We simply
#' spell out the name of the variable we wish to work with. ggplot is aware of
#' the dataset we work with -- it is *attached*. Quoting the variable names
#' would actually produce unexpected results:

ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line(aes(x = "year", y = "lifeExp", group = "country"))

#' What happened? ggplot interpreted the quoted strings as raw data instead of
#' variable names of our data frame. It then tries to plot it... **Always use
#' unquoted column names to address the variables in your data.**
#'
#' Let's colour all of the lines blue.

ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country), colour = "blue")

#' We wrote `colour = "blue"` outside of the `aes()` function as we *set* the
#' visual property to a fixed value instead of *mapping* a visual property to a
#' variable in the data frame. For comparison, let's move the colour
#' specification into the `aes()` function:

ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, colour = "blue"))

#' Classic ggplot moment here... "blue" gets interpreted as raw data as we have
#' written it inside of the `aes()` function. ggplot thinks all of our rows
#' belong to group "blue", mapped to the visual property colour. ggplot assigns
#' a default colour scale of which the first colour is a light red. Here's the
#' same behaviour, but this time it makes sense as we map colour to an actual
#' variable in our data set.

ggplot(data = gapminder) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country, colour = continent))

#' Lesson to be learned: The difference between *mapping* and *setting* a visual
#' property. **You map visual properties to variables inside `aes()`, you set
#' visual properties to a fixed value outside of `aes()`.**
#'
#' We can add more than a single layer to a plot. ggplot 2.0.0 comes with 27
#' *geometries* (`geom`). Some of them are super straightforward and just draw
#' points or lines or rectangles. Some draw complex shapes after transforming
#' your data in various ways. **Think of geometries as flexible templates for
#' different plot types.** Combining different geometries is a common workflow
#' in ggplot. E.g. adding `geom_point` to `geom_line` gives lines with points
#' on them:

# filter data to 4 countries only
gapminder_sub <-
  filter(gapminder,
         country %in% c("China", "Switzerland", "United States", "Somalia"))

ggplot(data = gapminder_sub) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country))

#' Note that we did not need to specify the `group` argument in the last ggplot
#' call. The have mapped colour to country and therefore implicitly specified
#' the grouping structure of our data. We use `group` only if ggplot fails to
#' correctly guess the grouping.

#' If we use identical mappings in our layers we can move them into the
#' `ggplot()` function. **Everything inside the `ggplot()` function is passed
#' down to all other plot elements.**

ggplot(data = gapminder_sub, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()

#' We can still add arguments to the individual layers.

ggplot(data = gapminder_sub, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = country)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = country))

#' Unlike in real life, we also have the power to override commands from above:

ggplot(data = gapminder_sub, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = country), colour = "black") +
  geom_point(aes(shape = country), colour = "black")

#'## Scales (versus aesthetics)

#' We already know that *aesthetics* are mappings from data dimensions to
#' visual properties. They tell ggplot what goes where. What are the
#' aesthetics in **Gapminder World**?
#'
#' Data dimension       Visual property                              Scale
#' -------------------  -------------------------------------------  -----------
#' GDP per capita       position on x-axis (`x`)                     `scale_x_*`
#' Life expectancy      position on y-axis (`y`)                     `scale_y_*`
#' Population size      size of plotting symbols (`size`)            `scale_size_*`
#' Geographical Region  colour of plotting symbols (`colour`)        `scale_colour_*`
#'
#' **Each aesthetic has its own scale**
#'
#' The four aesthetics in *Gapminder World* are connected to four different scales.
#' The scales are named after the corresponding aesthetic. The naming scheme is
#' `scale_<name of aesthetic>_<continuous|discrete|specialized>`.
#'
#' **Aesthetics specify the _what_, scales specify the _how_**
#'
#' Which colour to use for which level in the data? Where to put the labels on
#' the axis? Which labels to put? The size of the largest plotting symbol, the
#' name of the legends, log-transformation of the y-axis, the range of the
#' axis... These are all examples of scale specifications -- specifications on
#' *how* to map a data dimension to a visual attribute.
#'
#' Off to work!

head(gapminder)

#' The data already looks tidy. All we have to do is to subset to a single year.
#' Let's see what ggplot produces if we simply specify the aesthetics to an
#' appropriate geometry.

gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point()

#' A solid foundation. But to close in on the *Gapminder World* chart we need to
#' customize our scales.
#'
#' **When changing scale attributes we have to make sure to make the changes on
#' the appropriate scale**. Just ask yourself:
#'
#' 1) What aesthetic does the scale correspond to? `scale_<name of aesthetic>_*`
#' 2) Am I dealing with a *discrete* or *continuous* variable?
#' `scale_*_<continuous|discrete>`

#'### Scale names

#' Once you know which scales to use, names are trivial to change.

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life expectancy (years)") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#' You can also use mathematical annotation in your scale names. For further
#' information consult `?plotmath`.

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = expression(over(GDP, capita))) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = expression(e[0])) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#'### Scale transformations

#' Next, we deal with *scale transformations*. In **Gapminder World** the x-axis is
#' log-scaled meaning that the log of the x-axis data is taken before plotting.
#' However, the labels remain on the linear scale. In that regard transforming
#' scales is different from directly transforming the underlying data.

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)",
                     trans = "log10") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life expectancy (years)") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#' There are many different scale transformations built into ggplot. From the
#' documentation:
#'
#' > Built-in transformations include "asn", "atanh", "boxcox",
#' > "exp", "identity", "log", "log10", "log1p", "log2", "logit", "probability",
#' > "probit", "reciprocal", "reverse" and "sqrt".

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)",
                     trans = "reverse") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life expectancy (years)") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#' Note that the concept of scale transformations is not limited to position scales.

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)",
                     trans = "log10") +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life expectancy (years)") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total", trans = "log10")

#'### Scale breaks and labels

#' Next, we manually specify the axis *breaks* and *labels* to be the same as in
#' *Gapminder World*. Axis breaks are the positions where tick-marks and grid-lines
#' are drawn. Labels specify what text to put at the breaks. **Breaks and labels
#' have to be vectors of equal length.**

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)",
                     trans = "log10",
                     breaks = c(200, 300, 400, 500,
                                600, 700, 800, 900,
                                1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000,
                                6000, 7000, 8000, 9000,
                                10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000,
                                60000, 70000, 80000, 90000),
                     labels = c("200", "", "400", "",
                                "", "", "", "",
                                "1000", "2000", "", "4000", "",
                                "", "", "", "",
                                "10000", "20000", "", "40000", "",
                                "", "", "", "")) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life expectancy (years)",
                     breaks = c(25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50,
                                55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85)) +
  scale_color_discrete(name  = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#' OK, that was effective but clumsy. Luckily ggplot does not care *how* we
#' generate the vector of breaks. We can use any R function as long as it
#' outputs a vector. Even better, instead of manually spelling out the labels
#' for each break we can write a short function that takes the breaks as input
#' and formats them. Much nicer code -- same result.

gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Income per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted)",
                     trans = "log10",
                     breaks = apply(expand.grid(1:9, 10^(2:4)), 1, FUN = prod)[-1],
                     labels = function(x) {ifelse(grepl("^[124]", x), x, "")}) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Life expectancy (years)",
                     breaks = seq(25, 85, 5)) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Continent") +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#' The concept of *breaks* and *labels* does not only apply to continuous axis.
#' **All scales have breaks and labels**. E.g. on a colour scale the breaks are
#' the colour keys, the labels are -- well -- the labels. **We reorder the items
#' on our discrete scale by specifying the breaks in the required order.**
#' We also use an R function to capitalize the labels.

                       labels = toupper) +
  scale_size_continuous(name = "Population, total")

#' Finally, let's choose some sensible breaks and labels for the size scale.

#'### Sidenote: levels and order in ggplot

#' It is easy to order items on a numerical scale. One just puts them on the
#' number line. Usually low on the left and hight to the right. But what about
#' discrete items? ggplot orders them according to the order of their factor
#' levels. An example:

# test data
foo <- data.frame(id  = 1:4,
                  sex = c("Female", "Female", "Male", "Male"))
foo

#' `data.frame`, just like ggplot, automatically converts a character vector to
#' a factor using `as.factor`. The levels order of that factor follows the
#' sequence of occurrence in the data.
levels(foo$sex)

#' ggplot constructs discrete scales in the order of the levels of the
#' underlying factor variable. Here, Females first, males after.
ggplot(foo) +
  geom_point(aes(x = sex, y = id, color = sex))

#' If we reverse the level order of the sex variable we change the way ggplot
#' orders the discrete items.
foo$sex
foo$sex <- factor(foo$sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"))
foo$sex

#' Now we have males first and females last.
ggplot(foo) +
  geom_point(aes(x = sex, y = id, color = sex))
ggplot(foo) +
  geom_point(aes(x = sex, y = id, color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~sex)

#' **NEVER OVERRIDE THE LEVELS DIRECTLY WHEN JUST MEANING TO CHANGE THE ORDER!**
#' You'll screw up your data. In our case we just changed the sex of the
#' participants.
foo$sex
levels(foo$sex) <- c("Female", "Male")
foo$sex

#'### Scale limits

#' We match the maximum and minimum value of our xy-scales with those of the
#' *Gapminder World* chart by specifying the *limits* of the scales.
