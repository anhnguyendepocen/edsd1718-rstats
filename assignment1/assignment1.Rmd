1. Register at http://www.mortality.org/.
2. Download single year, single period death counts and exposures for a country of your choice.
3. *For each year in the data*, calculate life expectancy at birth^[See @preston2001 [p. 49, Box 3.1]] and the coefficient of variation of the life-table distribution of deaths.

You can calculate the coefficient of variation for a life-table as

$$
\widehat{\text{CV}} = \frac {\sqrt{\sum_{x=0}^\omega {}_nd_x(\overline{x}-e_0)^2}} {e_0} = \frac {\sqrt{\sum_{x=0}^\omega {}_nd_x(x+{}_na_x-e_0)^2}} {e_0},
$$

with ${}_na_x \approx 0.5n_x$.

(Bored? How about fitting a spline to the $\ell_x$ values of the life-table using `splinefun()` and use the continuous formula 7 with the fitted spline and numerical integration (`integrate()`) to calculate the Gini coefficient? No pressure though.)

4. Show the relationship among life-expectancy and the coefficient of variation of the life-table distribution of deaths. What do you see? If you have an explanation for the relationship I would be interested in reading about it.
