#'## Probability distributions

#' Mortality after age 110 is flat with a death rate of 0.7 deaths per
#' person-year lived (cp. Gampe, J. (2010) "Human mortality beyond age 110"). We
#' can therefore model the distribution of deaths past age 110 with an
#' exponential density with a rate paramenter of 0.7.

# The age distribution of deaths for those who survived until age 110.
d110 <- dexp(x = seq(0, 20, 0.1), rate = 0.7)
plot(x = 110 + seq(0, 20, 0.1), y = d110, type = 'l')

#' Of those who survived until age 110, what share has died until age 115?
p <- pexp(q = 5, rate = 0.7)
p
p110 <- pexp(q = seq(0, 20, 0.1), rate = 0.7)
plot(x = 110 + seq(0, 20, 0.1), y = p110, type = 'l')
abline(h = p, v = 115, col = 'red', lty = 2)

#' Of those who survived until age 110, what share is still alive one year later?
l <- 1 - pexp(q = 1, rate = 0.7)
l
l110 <- 1 - pexp(q = seq(0, 20, 0.1), rate = 0.7)
plot(x = 110 + seq(0, 20, 0.1), y = l110, type = 'l')
abline(h = l, v = 111, col = 'red', lty = 2)

#' Of those who survived until age 110, at what age will half of them have died?
q <- 110 + qexp(p = 0.5, rate = 0.7)
q
q110 <- 110 + qexp(p = seq(0, 1, 0.01), rate = 0.7)
plot(x = seq(0, 1, 0.01), y = q110, type = 'l')
abline(h = q, v = 0.5, col = 'red', lty = 2)

#' If 10,000 people reach age 110, what is the probability to observe a person
#' reaching age 127?
10000 * (1 - pexp(q = 17, rate = 0.7))

#' How many people must live to 110 for a 99 percent change of someone surviving
#' to age 127?
0.99/(1 - pexp(q = 17, rate = 0.7))

#' What could a sample of 100 people who survived until age 110 look like in
#' terms of their ages at death?

#'## The central-limit theorem

#' The average age at death for those who survive until age 110+:
n110_smpl_mean <- mean(n110)
n110_smpl_mean

#' Let's say we have only observed a sub-sample of this population.
n110_smpl <- sample(n110, size = 40, replace = FALSE)
mean(n110_smpl)

#' What is the sampling distribution around the mean of our sub-sample? The 
#' central limit theorem states that it is normal. To demonstrate this fact we 
#' will draw 500 additional samples from the full population and for each sample
#' calculate the mean. The distribution of these sample averages should be 
#' approximately normal.
resmpl <- matrix(NA, nrow = 500, ncol = 40)

#'## The bootstrap

#' What is the 95% confidence interval around the mean age of death of
#' supercentenarians? We can use the bootstrap to answer this question.

# size of sample
n <- length(n110)
# number of bootstrap replications
k <- 500

# do the bootstrap
btrap <- matrix(NA, nrow = k, ncol = n)
for (i in 1:k) {
  btrap[i,] <- sample(n110, size = n, replace = TRUE)
}

#' We calculate the statistic of interest (in our case the mean) for each
#' version of the bootstrapped samples.
btrap_mean <- apply(btrap, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)

#' The histogram of the distribution of the bootstrapped means shows the 
#' sampling distribution of the means.
hist(btrap_mean)
abline(v = mean(n110), col = 'red', lwd = 2)

#' We can then calculate statistics for the sampling distribution of the means
#' such the standard deviation, which we will call the standard error of the
#' estimate for the sample mean.
sd_btrap_mean <- sd(btrap_mean)

#' Having estimated the standard error of the sample mean we can construct
#' confidence intervals.
mean(n110) - 1.96*sd_btrap_mean
mean(n110) + 1.96*sd_btrap_mean

#' Compare that to the confidence intervals as calculated from a t.test:
t.test(n110)

#' The advantage of the bootstrap is that it provides us with an estimate for
#' the standard error of all kinds of statistics. Next, we bootstrap 95 %
#' confidence intervals for the coefficient of variation of the ages at death
#' for supercentenarians.
