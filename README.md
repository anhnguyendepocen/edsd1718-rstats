### Format

Please email me the finished assignments (jschoeley@health.sdu.dk). For each assignment I would like you to send me at least 2 files:
  1. the source code (`.R`, or `.Rmd`), and
  2. a pdf with your code, your comments, your results and your answers to the questions in the assignment.

If you have downloaded data for the assignment please send me this data as well.

### If you need help

Of course *you can and should* take advantage of your peers when you're stuck. This *does not mean* to copy the solutions but instead to ask for help on specific problems. You can also send me a mail asking for advice. Make sure to attach your data and code to the email so I can have a look at what went wrong.

### Grading

You get a *pass* if you hand in all of your assignments. There are 3 ways to get a *high pass*:
  1. Do you assignments very well, i.e. maybe do a bit more than I've asked for.
  2. Write down which problems you've encountered while working on the assignment and how you've solved them.
  3. Hand in some special assignment that I've given you (that is for those who already know R).
